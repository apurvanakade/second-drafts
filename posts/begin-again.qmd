I opened this page with a clear idea of what I wanted to write. I've now spent the last half hour updating quarto, setting up a new git repository, fixing a git merge issue, figuring out how to render drafts... this was a mistake. When I have something to write, I need to get the words out as soon as possible without worrying about their final destination.

One of the protagonist in [1Q84](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10357575-1q84), Tengo, is a writer. He teaches math at cram schools to make a living but his real passion is writing. At some point in his life he has to decide between writing and math, and he decides to write. Tengo is my alter-ego from a different dimension - funny that the book itself is about different dimensions. 
He chose writing just as I chose math. Thankfully math pays so I do not have to teach writing for a living. 

I've always loved writing. I have had several blogs representing different phrases of my life, each reflective of what I was going through at the time but haven't maintained one of late for various inane excuses.

Recently I started reading [The Artist's Way](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way) and it inspired me to write again. I sometimes get stuck in arguments and trying to find reasons to justify doing something. But really, I just enjoy putting thoughts into words, and that is justification enough. I heard Neil Gaiman talk about how he likes to write with a fountain pen. And I do too, I find it magical to see words appear on paper. But, I write much slower on paper than I can think. And I move around a lot so I do not have the luxury of carrying a leaky pen with me. Writing here is the equivalent of writing with a fountain pen for me - just watching words magically appear on the screen out of nowhere.

This journal is going to be a collection of my second drafts - nothing polished or well-thought but not stream-of-conscious either. And as Sam Harris says, it's never late to begin again.
