I’ve now spent the last half an hour updating quarto, creating a new github repository, fixing a git merge issue on the old repository, figuring out how to render drafts …\nThis was a mistake. When I have something to write, I need to get the words out as soon as possible without worrying about where are going to go.\n\nOne of the protagonist in 1Q84, Tengo, is a writer. He teaches math at cram schools to make a living but his real passion is writing. At some point in his life he as to decide between writing and math, and he decides to write.\nTengo is my alter-ego from a different dimension - funny that the book itself is about different dimensions, as is always the case with Murakami’s novels. I don’t have a talent for writing but I’ve always loved writing. I have had several blogs in different parts of my life each quite reflective of the what I was going through at the time.\nI haven’t blogged in the past few years. I can think of many excuses.\n\nI wanted to focus more on math writing and my work.\nDo people write any more? Isn’t this the age of videos?\nWhy write a blog at all that nobody reads?\n\nBut then recently I started reading The Artist’s Way and it inspired me to write again."

When I have something to write, I need to get the words out as soon as possible without worrying about their final destination.\n\nOne of the protagonist in 1Q84, Tengo, is a writer. He teaches math at cram schools to make a living but his real passion is writing. At some point in his life he has to decide between writing and math, and he decides to write. Tengo is my alter-ego from a different dimension - funny that the book itself is about different dimensions. He chose writing just as I chose math. Thankfully math pays so I do not have to teach writing for a living.\nI’ve always loved writing. I have had several blogs representing different phrases of my life, each reflective of what I was going through at the time but haven’t maintained one of late for various inane excuses.\nRecently I started reading The Artist’s Way and it inspired me to write again. I sometimes get stuck in arguments and trying to find reasons to justify doing something. But really, I just enjoy putting thoughts into words, and that is justification enough. I heard Neil Gaiman talk about how he likes to write with a fountain pen. And I do too, I find it magical to see words appear on paper. But, I write much slower on paper than I can think. And I move around a lot so I do not have the luxury of carrying a leaky pen with me. Writing here is the equivalent of writing with a fountain pen for me - just watching words magically appear on the screen out of nowhere.\nThis journal is going to be a collection of my second drafts - nothing polished or well-thought but not stream-of-conscious either. And as Sam Harris says, it’s never late to begin again."
