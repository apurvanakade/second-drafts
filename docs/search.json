He teaches math at cram schools to make a living but his real passion is writing. At some point in his life he as to decide between writing and math, and he decides to write.\nTengo is my alter-ego from a different dimension - funny that the book itself is about different dimensions, as is always the case with Murakami’s novels. I don’t have a talent for writing but I’ve always loved writing.

I can think of many excuses.\n\nI wanted to focus more on math writing and my work.\nDo people write any more? Isn’t this the age of videos?\nWhy write a blog at all that nobody reads?\n\nBut then recently I started reading The Artist’s Way and it inspired me to write again."
