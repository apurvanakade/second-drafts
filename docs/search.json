He chose writing where as I chose math. Thankfully math pays so I do not have to teach writing for a living.\nI’ve always loved writing. I have had several blogs representing different phrases of my life, each reflective of what I was going through at the time.

I sometimes get stuck in logic and rationalizing and trying to find reasons to do something. But really, I just enjoy putting thoughts into words, and that is reason enough. I heard Neil Gaiman talk about how he likes to write with a fountain pen. And I do too, I find it magical to see words appear on paper. But, I write much slower on paper than I can think. And I move around a lot so I do not have the luxury of carrying ink cartridges with me. For me, writing here is the equivalent of writing with a fountain pen. Just watching words magically appear on the screen out of nowhere.\nI’m calling this journal Second Drafts as that’s what it’s going to be. Nothing polished or well-thought but not stream-of-conscious either. I hope to write what comes to mind and then do one scan to clean it up. As Sam Harris says, it’s never late to begin again."
