    "text": "I opened this page with a clear idea of what I wanted to write. I’ve now spent the last half hour updating quarto, setting up a new git repository, fixing a git merge issue, figuring out how to render drafts… this was a mistake. When I have something to write, I need to get the words out as soon as possible without worrying about their final destination.\n\nOne of the protagonist in 1Q84, Tengo, is a writer. He teaches math at cram schools to make a living but his real passion is writing. At some point in his life he has to decide between writing and math, and he decides to write. Tengo is my alter-ego from a different dimension. He chose writing just as I chose math. Thankfully math pays so I do not have to teach writing for a living.\nI’ve always loved writing. I have had several blogs representing different phrases of my life, each reflective of what I was going through at the time but haven’t maintained one of late for various inane excuses.\nI recently started reading The Artist’s Way and it inspired me to write again. I sometimes get stuck in arguments, trying to find reasons to justify doing or not doing something, analysis paralysis. Very simply though, I just enjoy putting thoughts into words, which is justification enough to write. I heard Neil Gaiman talk about how he likes to write with a fountain pen. Writing here is the equivalent of writing with a fountain pen for me - just watching words magically appear on the screen out of nowhere.\nThis journal is going to be a collection of my second drafts - nothing polished or well-thought but not stream-of-conscious either. As Sam Harris says, it’s never late to begin again.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The barycentric coordinates can be interpreted as the relative areas of the sub-triangles formed with the point \\(P\\) and the vertices of the triangle.\nThere are many ways of seeing why this is true. Here’s one visual interpretation: First consider the triangle with vertices \\((0, 0)\\), \\((1, 0)\\), and \\((0, 1)\\). A point \\((x, y)\\) is inside this triangle exactly when: \\[\n0 \\le x, \\quad 0 \\le y, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x + y \\le 1\n\\] In this case, we can write the point \\((x, y)\\) as: \\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}\n=\n(1 - x - y) \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} +\nx \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} +\ny \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\] So the barycentric coordinates of \\((x, y)\\) are \\((1 - x - y, x, y)\\), all of which are non-negative and sum to 1. Now all you need to do is map \\((0, 0)\\), \\((1, 0)\\), and \\((0, 1)\\) to the vertices of the triangle \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), respectively, via an affine transformation. The barycentric coordinates of a point \\(P\\) inside the triangle with vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are given by the same formula as above, with the standard triangle’s vertices replaced by \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\).\nYou can see this in the app above: move the blue point around the triangle and watch how the barycentric coordinates change. You can also move the vertices of the red triangle and observe how the coordinates adapt.\n\nThis post was an excuse for me to learn how to use ObservableJS. I was initially planning on using Python and Plotly, but Plotly is absurdly immature in terms of interactivity. Most of the code is generated by ChatGPT. I merely edited it to fit my needs.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "It’s a crisp sunny day in the middle of way. We are deep into the final exam season. Everyone is stressed, sleep-deprived, over-caffeinated, over-worked. We have an exam for our course at 2 pm.\nWe arrive at the classroom to find it has a capacity of 150, and guess how many students we have in the class? 144. On the top of that, many of the chairs are broken. Oh and these are old, old chairs, fixed to the floor, tiny, uncomfortable - perfect for a 3 hour exam.\nProfessors have been complaining for years about outdated classrooms and what does Hopkins administration decide to do - build a new student center. The cherry on top is that the library is closed for “renovations” for ages now. So not only do we not have enough classrooms but students also do not have a place to study. Academics is clearly no longer a priority here.\nThis is just the way of life here and we have gotten accustomed to it. But today, for something extra special, it being the finals week after all, there was “Fire Alarm Test” DURING THE EXAM. Mind you, Hopkins really cares about it’s students. All the buildings are locked to provide quiet zones for students. So a fire alarm going on every 5 mins for an hour straight during the exam is totally fine. The administration has done their duty by posting “quite please” signs in the hallways. Now please donate to Hopkins so they can build a world class jacuzzi.\nWhat. A. Joke.\n\n\n\n Back to top",
